# Explaining Educational Data: A Taxonomy of XAI Tools and Techniques for the Educational Data Mining Community

Anonymous supplementary material of the paper "Explaining Educational Data: A Taxonomy of XAI Tools and Techniques for the Educational Data Mining Community" submitted to Educational Data Mining Conference (2025).

## Abstract

The rise of machine learning (ML) has made it possible to analyse educational data with the aim of making predictions about academic performance or recommend courses, among others. A persistent problem lies in the lack of transparency of the resulting ML models, which makes them difficult to be useful for teachers and other educational profiles without deep knowledge in ML. The principles of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are especially needed in the educational data mining (EDM) community. In this work, we present a taxonomy of XAI tools that can be used in the context of EDM, offering a detailed analysis of the methods they provide and their user-level characteristics. Our analysis of the adoption of XAI techniques in recent contributions to the EDM conference reveals that these tools are underused in the community. Our work discusses the potential of these tools to inspect ML models and better understand their predictions in the EDM field. With this, we want to contribute to expanding the use of lesser-known XAI techniques and highlight the usefulness of the tools to perform more comprehensive visual analyses.

## Additional material

This repository includes the following documents:

- Check-list to assess the quality of the documentation in XAI tools.
- Spreadsheed with the evaluation of XAI tools based on the three dimensions of the proposed taxonomy:
	- Metadata dimension: Classification of the tools according to technical and availability characteristics.
	- Scope and general purpose dimension: Evaluation of the functionalities supported by the tool in terms of data types, ML models and forms of explanation.
	- Explainaibility methods dimension: Detailed categorisation of the explainable methods implemented.
